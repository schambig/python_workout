# Practicing with packages:

- Use packages with and without `__init__.py`:

    The `__init__.py` file is not required for Python packages since Python 3.3. This means that you can create a Python package without an `__init__.py` file and it will still be importable. However, it is still a good practice to include an empty `__init__.py` file in your packages, as it can help to prevent errors and make your code more readable.

    Here are some of the reasons why you might want to include an `__init__.py` file in your Python packages:

    - To define package-level variables or functions.
    - To mark a directory as a package.
    - To prevent errors when importing modules from the package.
    - To make your code more readable and organized.

    If you are not sure whether or not to include an `__init__.py` file in your Python packages, it is generally safe to do so. However, if you are not using any of the features that require an `__init__.py` file, you can omit it.
